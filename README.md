This is the GitHub repo for the Origins: Genshin mod.

Wanna get started? You can visit the [wiki](https://origins-genshin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). *Almost* everything you need should be there.

Wanna report a bug? You can use GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/botcoder69/origins-genshin/issues)! Make sure to search for existing issues first, I don't really wanna run into duplicate issues.
It would be really helpful if you can provide:
- Mods that you were using
- Your Minecraft version (should be 1.20.2, that's the only version this mod supports at the moment.)
- The version of **Origins: Genshin** you were using
- What should happen, and what happened instead. (Screenshots are really useful here!)
- A client and/or server log.
Don't forget to add a label! It helps me classify your issue more easily.

Wanna create a PR? Go ahead! This is my first actual Fabric mod, so improvements are greatly appreciated.
